## Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"

### Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:

* Download the zip file from this URL.
* Unzip the file.

Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R). 
Note: reshape2 package is required to run the script (downloaded from CRAN).

The output of the R script is a tidy data set (tidy_Data.txt).

Read more about the data and the clean up performed in the code book.
